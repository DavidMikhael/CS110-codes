    "For collision resolution, I decided to use separate chaining instead of open addressing. Separate chaining has a time complexity of O(1+a) where a is the load ratio and equals n.keys/m. Open addressing, on the other hand, takes O(1/(1-a)) time for insert and search methods. Therefore, for a high load ratio, separate chaining, whose time relationship is linear, does exponentially better than open addressing. So, minimizing space complexity (m) as much as possible also leverages the benefits of separate chaining having a relatively more efficient runtime with high load ratios (to support its selection against open addressing). However, I needed to make sure I avoid collisions as much as possible, and that's why I don't want my base \"d\" to be small for hash values to be segregated. So, I chose m to be the smallest value possible that can hold all the k-long substrings and that is larger than the largest possible hash value of base \"d\" (given that k could be as large as 5; if k is larger then we might need to increase m). Note that the power of base d solves the problem of similar but different order substrings. I suppose that this plagiarism detector would be used for student submissions at Minerva. The average assignment length is 1200 words and let's say the average number of characters in each word is 4 characters. This gives me n.keys = 1200*4 / k keys needed to be inserted into the hash table slots. Increasing k means less slots needed but a higher hash value for each.\n",
    "\n",
    "To satisfy all those constraints, benefit from the advantages of separate chaining, optimize segregation of hash values, and minimize space complexity, I selected m to be \"1000117\" considering that it should prime and thus lead to few collisions and away from a power of base 2, and d to be \"16\". Note also that the runtime of this separate chaining implementation will still be efficient if my detector was used for larger texts which adds to its practicality with different inputs. \n",

    "In this universal hashing algorithm, I had to decide on a value for A and for m. For A, I needed a value that, when mutiplied by the sum of ord() outputs, rarely yields an integer, for the remainder of its division by zero to exist. Cormen et., al. has the optimal value for A to be \"(math.sqrt(5) - 1) / 2\". \n",

    "m is a key variable that distinguishes my four different multiplicative hash functions. Therefore, and to ensure that each has hash function produce non-overlapping ranges of hash values, I had to make the m for each significantly different, and the m values large in general for the floor of (ke*A % 1)*m to be greater than zero in almost all cases. They are powers of 2 as Cormen et., al. advised. Although adjusting m doesn't help in preventing collisions when they happen, the use of universal hashing does. \n",

    "Therefore, I chose m values for my four functions to be 2^16, 2^18, 2^20, 2^22. The least possible table size that can hold all keys and include hash slots for the largest hash value is approximately 1e7. This will help me later when I compare both algorithm since I have the same table size in both and thus fixed space complexity and load ratios with the same input.\n",

However, they have the same space complexity in terms of table size. I will expand on the comparison later."

    "Since a random hash function from a list of functions, with a different range of hash values, is chosen each time we initialize the function, we avoid worst-case collision scenarios from an adversary who knows our hash conditions. While searching, we use the same seed value to lookup keys based on hash values of the hash function that is randomly picked. One way to improve my algorithm is to re-chose a random hash function each time we find a collision and again set the seed for searching so that we avoid collisions while still maintaining searching functionality. For example, if we have a string \"avivia\" and we need to find common substrings with \"via\" and k = 3, normally a collision occurs because two keys have the same hash value (assuming we don't use powers as in rolling hashing). In this case, picking a random hash function each time, a one that might cause hashes of these two keys to be different, make us avoid worst-case complexities in such scenarios. My first two functions already have this functionality: the hash values of the first two (or one) letters are calculated differently from the rest. The only thing that my implementation misses is re-hashing whenever a collision is encountered and I am interested to compare the algorithm's behavior without this function now, and when I implement it in the future.\n",

Let's say that this piece of text is a student's assignment submission and we want to see how substrings of length k are common between it and another student's submission. We then take the other piece of text, chunk it into keys, calculate the hash values for each using the same method used in the table, and search for each hash value in the table to see if its key exists (i.e. if the substring is common). It then returns the index, in each piece of text, that mark the beginning of each common substring.\n",

    "From the experimental analysis plot, we can see that the time complexity of the rolling hashing algorithm is lower than that of the universal hashing as the number of letters in an input word increases. I already explained why this is the case when I discussed the universal hashing algorithm.\n",

    "The time complexity for rolling hashing is O(n) to find the indices of all common substrings. Creating the hash table takes O(n) where n is the number of characters in the input we are passing through to calculate hash values. Searching for the key of a given hash value takes O(1) time for all keys because we don't have to compute hash values every time. Therefore, the runtime scales as a function of O(n) where n is the number of characters in the piece of text that we want to test for plagiarism. \n",

    " #algorithms: I created valid and efficient algorithmic strategies for each part of my plagiarism detector code. First, I focused on creating a code that works. Constructing an algorithmic code that results in the output I expect for each step is what I need to focus on before I consider time or space efficiency. Then, I did a reverse outline for those algorithmic steps and carefully went over them many times before I specifued which part of the algorithm I could refine to increase its efficiency. For example, I saw which parts have high time complexity and focus on them to improve time efficiency in the second algorithm. I also explained how I made those edits to show how I improve my algorithm.\n",

    " #constraints: This problem requires the use of hash tables, which we weren’t introduced to in class. This imposed an obstacle that must be overcome by getting familiar with hash tables and practicing them before I start incorporating them into my algorithm for detecting plagiarism. I did this by reading the resources mentioned in the problem description, and also looking for more videos explaining the topic since videos prove to be more effective for me to understand computational concepts. One constraint in my algorithm for universal multiplicative hashing is the still possible occurence of collisions, which I can overcome using the methods I mentioned.\n",

Initially I made comments that were exaggeratedly explaining my steps and that were too long, making my code not clearly readable. Therefore, I needed to make my code clear, my comments quick and clear, and suit the minds of the graders. I also made sure my comments are not redundant.\n",
