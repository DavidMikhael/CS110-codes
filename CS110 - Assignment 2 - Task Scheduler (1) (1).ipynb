    "The tasks I include are essential to my daily life; they are not all executed everyday, but these are essentially what fill my time during the semester apart from academics. Yoga and Gym are essential for my physical and mental health. Violin and listening to my friend's compositions help improve my mood and add energy. The church kids serive and English tutoring are two activities that allow me to interact with different people in the city of SF and get outside my comfort zone while helping others. Calling family is essential for my mental wellbeing and for theirs too, and studying at SF public library is more productive that anywhere else with books that help me know more about the culture and history of SF. Finally, I need to do make healthy food whenever I want to go to the gym to save money and build muscles. Some tasks need to be done before others (have sub tasks). Tasks and their subtasks have the same priority level. \n",
    "\n",
    "I store these tasks in a list of tuples because I find it easier to deal with and since I don't need a mutable data type; my input tasks are always the same. In the table, each row represents a task, and each column represents a property of that task. Each task had an id from 1 to 9, a duration in minutes and a list of task(s) it is dependent on. Each task also has a status that is \"not started\" by default but gets updated during the code. Finally, each task also has an \"availability\" value which is basically how many days of the week this task could be done on. This is my priority value, where a task that could be done on only a few number of days has a higher priority of being completed on time than another one that could be done at any time. Sunday is a day when all these tasks could be done, so I assume that these are Sunday's tasks; For example, Church service and English tutoring could only be done on Sundays and thus they are prioritized than other tasks that could still be done on other days.\n",
    "\n",
    "My scheduler works by first checking if there still tasks that are not completed yet or in the priority queue. If yes, it takes tasks that are not started yet, and those that don't have dependencies, and use the \"heappush\" function to insert them into a priority queue. The heappush function inserts those executable tasks to the priority queue in an ascending order of their priority which is the \"availability\" value. Then, the scheduler extracts the first task in the priority queue (the one with highest priority), execute it with recorded time, change its status to completed, and remove it from any dependency list so that tasks that are dependent on it can be executed. After the task is extracted using \"heappop\", \"heapify\" resorts the priority queue. After we finish our first iteration, we check tasks again to push to the queue those who weren't included before because they had dependencies that are now executed. This gives us an appropriate priority queue that we, again, extract the first element of and execute it, and so on until we finish all tasks (that is, until the length of the priority queue is 0 and all tasks are COMPLETED. \n",
    "\n",
    "A minimum priority queue is a suitable data structure for sorting tasks because it ensures that the heap sorting property is maintained at each iteration, where each task we extract at each time is the root parent node and thus it is the one with the highest priority (the least availability value). So, we can execute tasks based on priorities we assign to each. Moreever, the priority queue consider dependencies because only elements whose dependencies has been executed enter the priority queue. Therefore, as seen in the output, the scheduler considers both priorities and dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "The example output I have is excellent because each task, along with its subtasks, is executed one after another based on its priority, that is common over all subtasks, given the dependency constraints. "

    "Each task also has a multitasking metric, which is cogntivei demand, from 0 to 1, with values near one meaning a very demanding task that is not likely to be multitasked, and values near zero meaning a task that could be done with other tasks, condition on the sum of the two values being not more than one. For example, Studying music theory (demand = 0.6) can be done with listening to my Friend's recent musical piece (demand = 0.4) but not with preparing gifts for kids (demand = 0.5).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the time counter, I made sure that a task starts only after the \"longest\" one of the two tasks that are multitasked is executed. I also made sure that the counter includes the time of beginning each of the multitasksed tasks (which is the same) and the time of finishing each separately (if their duration is different). Finally, I thought why we, after finishing the main task of the multitasked pair, would still spend more time in the secondary task if it takes longer. But since it's secondary and not cognitively demanding, I decided that this is better than allocating a whole different time slot for it (e.g. listening to my friend's music piece).\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, I made sure that no more than two tasks can be done at the same time. I set my multitasking limit to be 2, since I am not efficient in doing more than 2 tasks at the same time whatever these tasks are. Also, I made the code search for potenial tasks to be multitasked in only the first 3 elements of the priority queue, which are most likely to be subtasks of the same task.\n",
    "\n",
    "The outcome of this algorithm is also excellent because non-demanding subtasks of the same task are efficiently executed together followed by their main task (that is dependent on them), and this process happens for one main task after another based on the priority values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that when I use multitasking, there should some minor changes in the order of some tasks but which do not impact my overall schedule goals and expectations. For example, I can do church service after I finish all tasks that concern service and tutoring, or after I only finish church service tasks. Both ways are equally efficient to me and I might alternate between them.\n"

I also start with tasks that need my attention more (service, tutoring, and studying), then do yoga to refresh, call family for a better mood, and then look after my health in terms of diet and exercise. After that, I will be mentally tired, so it will be a good idea to just hangout with friends, which is also essential for mental health, and can be done any day except Thursday (I have Capstone and workstudy) and Monday (the busy beginning of the week). Finally, I like to end my day with some music to have good dreams, but I can't do that on Friday because I have workstudy the whole evening.  \n",

To use this schedule, I need to train myself to be more productive and waste less time each day so that I can follow all tasks, or make the schedule more tolerant of my shortcomings. Some tasks could also be done twice, such as Calling family. Assuming that I trained myself on productivity, I don't have to do any task more than twice (or have discipline to not do so), and I have day-specific tasks for each day, I can started using this schedule effectively.\n"

On the other hand, the fact that I must use one priority metric for all task types imposes a constraint that I partially overcame by choosing a plausible priority value for each main task, but these priority values better be scaled in order to make them distinct between tasks that I want to sort them in a specific way.
